If you've tried accessing the site recently, you probably noticed it is down. I'm having some server troubles; one's that would be easy to fix if I had direct access to it. Unfortunately, the Network on Campus disables servers, so I have to leave mine at home, and being over an hour away makes it difficult to make minor changes. I almost have a remote-access system up, but it's hard to make router settings changes if I can't reach the firewall, and trying to walk my family though it over the phone would be a nightmare.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, pretty much all the information available on the site is also on our new Facebook page. And this blog should update to a <a href="http://twitter.com/rabidaudio">Twitter account</a>, which should then update to the Facebook news feed. Very messy.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">EDIT 9/21:</span> Next weekend the server will be down (not that you can tell a difference; it's been down for several weeks now while I've been away) while I switch to a significantly more secure, more reliable Linux system (I will be using </span><a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/server" style="font-style: italic;">Ubuntu 10.4 Server Edition</a><span style="font-style: italic;">, if you are curious) and away from crummy Win7.</span><br />
<br />

It will finalize my DAW and I can actually start professionally recording stuff.<br />
<br />
It has a Firewire connection that works seamlessly with Logic, ProTools, etc. You move a slider in the software, and the slider on the mixer moves with it, which is one of the coolest things I have ever seen. Plus, multi-layer recording, MIDI control, and so much other cool shit.<br />
<br />
Hopefully, I won't get too antsy and spend my savings on <a href="http://www.ehx.com/products/stereo-memory-man-with-hazarai">something else</a>.

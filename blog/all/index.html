      <p>Now that I’ve (finally!) completed my degree, I’m venturing out into the real world.
In the back of my mind I always wanted to be my own boss. I’ve had the entrepreneurial
drive since before I knew what that meant. Like many of my peers, I sold candy and
little toys to my peers when I was in grade school (at least until Mrs. Wiggins shut
us down- shame on her!).

I’m now officially accepting contracts for design work through RabidAudio. That’s right,

      <p>A year ago this month, it was announced that the US would be transferring control of the DNS Root Zone. As of writing, it is still to be determined who that organization is or what that ownership will look like. This transfer, if it ever actually occurs, stands to have major effects on the internet and control over it.

Enhancements


  Added a test suite
    
      The tests are really slow, because basically each one spawns a process and then makes a network request. There’s probably some room for optimization here

February marks one year of recording everything I watch in a spreadsheet. The full data, including date, format, and who I watched it with (if applicable), is available on Google Docs, but here are some statistics and highlights, because why not.

In total there were 100 films, as well as 9 seasons of televison shows (which I’m removing from this analysis). This leaves an even 100 films, which is convenient for percentages.

In the future, I’m going to add a column for year, add separ...</p>

One of my new years resolutions is to accomplish something in a side project every week, whether that means
a major step in a big project or the completion of a smaller project (another is to blog more, so these
work together nicely). Here’s this week’s.

but I finally gave in and used the real thing. It’s a lot more flexible than I expected, and over all I’m loving it. There
was just one thing I learned in my previous attempt that I really wanted, and that was Grunt.

If you aren’t familiar, grunt is a script runner for javascript, analogous to rake in the Rails

In researching this, I discovered that at least three of these artists are on Jagjaguwar, and at least four are on Matador. I couldn't bring myself to rank them exactly, so eac...</p>

      <p>Somehow at all my past employers (with the exception of my highschool retail job), I’ve been asked to assist in the interview process for new employees. This was in spite of the fact that these were all intern jobs. Maybe this is common practice, but I get the impression that it isn’t. In any case, it should be. I’ve learned a lot not just about how to interview well, but about how to find and recognize talent. If you own a company and your interns don’t sit in on interviews, at least for new...</p>

It will spin up a static file webserver on your local machine, and spit back a link you can try in your browser. Ctrl-C to kill when you are done.

      <p>Since I had first been introduced to the wearable computing community, I have always wanted to build a chorded keyboard. I've had some basic design in my head for a while, but now that the hardware part has been&nbsp;started, I felt it was time for a post. Simply put, a chorded keyboard is a keyboard device that you use with one hand, where different combinations of buttons ("chords") represent different keys on a keyboard.

I went with the PIE model, as it was slightly cheaper. As soon as I got it, I popped it open. As it turns out, the biggest chip on the board is an Atmel ATMEGA168 (for those of you w...</p>

      <p>On my last visit to Radio Shack, I went in for a small PCB, and came out with a bag full of ICs, switches, jacks, and inspiration. The first idea was thanks to a 555 timer. Tom Morello and Buckethead sound awesome with their killswitches, and DIY guitarists love to play with them as well. What if you didn't have to use your strumming had to use the switch? After some function crunching (I was looking for a circuit that would switch at frequencies from about .5 Hz to about 15 Hz with duty cycl...</p>

It's a simple little site, hosted on a server from Webs.com (the tag in the url is the cost of free hosting). Here it is: http://musicandpiracy.webs.com/ If you like it, please distribute the pdf.

      <p>I stumbled upon this article from a couple months ago in The Economist entitled "How to Sink Pirates" (the article is "Primium Content" on their website,** but if you are on the Berry College intranet, you can read it here). In it, the author argues that the "best way to discourage it is to offer a diverse range of attractive, legal alternatives." However, the author suggests that these alternatives are things like dollar songs on the iTunes Music Store. But 35% goes straight to Apple. The ot...</p>

      <p>So today Butch Walker released his new album, I Liked It Better When You Had No Heart. I gave it a listen, and I am quite impressed. With catchy melodies and creative lyrics, this album stands proudly with the rest. Not to say that it sounds the same. Butch seems to have strayed further away from the kinda-rough-but-still-pretty sound of Rise and Fall (think "Bethamphetamine"), but still manages to keep all the slow songs entertaining and beautiful. Plus, the acoustic version of "Don't Move" ...</p>

      <p>Late last month, concert companies Ticketmaster and Live Nation merged, after approval from the US Anti-Trust. Both companies made venues sign contracts for exclusive access to ticket sales from over 100 venues in the US. The new company (keeping the name Live Nation) claims this will allow them to lower ticket prices. However, both companies have been accused of inflating their service fees in the past (a Coldplay ticket on Live Nation priced at $35 had over $20 extra in service fees this pa...</p>

<p>Every year, <a href="https://fourth-strike.bandcamp.com/">Fourth Strike</a> (the record label/not-for-profit music collective behind <a href="https://thegarages.bandcamp.com/">the garages</a>) does a little community song jam. Participants are encouraged to make one song a week for for weeks. Each week has a theme and some optional additional challenges. It‚Äôs a fun, low-pressure environment to practice making music.</p>

<p>This year I did my best to participate consistently. I‚Äôve put the results on <a href="https://serioustimes.bandcamp.com">Bandcamp</a>, with the more post-rock songs under Serious Times and the more twee emo songs under a new name, Slow Church.</p>

<p><strong>Update 2024-03-01</strong>: The song jam album dropped today. You should listen, there are some real gems on here. Particular standouts are PINK HEART, polaris, Prelude to Avunculicide, and Pure Propaganda.</p>

<h2 id="week-1-phone-it-in">Week 1: PHONE IT IN</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>CHALLENGE: The title of your song must be the name of one of your ‚Äúmost used‚Äù emojis</p>

  <p>BONUS CHALLENGE: Oops, your phone is running out of storage. Better make the song shorter than 1m 59s!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For week one, I made a little spoken word piece which was what I‚Äôd wished I‚Äôd said during some mildly transphobic incident (basically a shower argument), and placed it over some sloppy twangly midwest emo guitar. Trying to to channel <a href="https://discounteddanceparties.bandcamp.com/album/a-little-light-of-our-own">american poetry club</a> or something like that. It‚Äôs cringingly twee.</p>

<h2 id="week-2-art-heist">Week 2: ART HEIST</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>CHALLENGE: For this week‚Äôs inspiration, we‚Äôre breaking into a modern art gallery. Your inspiration are the two pieces of artwork below - feel free to take inspiration from one or both of them however you like!</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <p><a href="https://www.wikiart.org/en/mark-rothko/yellow-cherry-orange">Yellow, Cherry, Orange by Mark Rothko</a></p>
    </li>

    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>BONUS CHALLENGE: Good artists copy, great artists steal. Incorporate one or both of the ‚ÄúBonus Sample‚Äù audio files <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1h-Es4WGtNWn6Jo5QQn64dFlYJU_VkIlw">in the folder below</a> - you may edit, sample, or rerecord them however you like</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Rothko gave me vibes like the sun, oppressive brightness and heat in a desert or something like that. Meanwhile the second sample is like a de-tuned drone in the Bb/C range that felt similarly oppressive. I decided to detune the instruments to match that sample pitch, and write a chord progression that utilized that pitch somewhere in each chord, keeping it droning through the song.</p>

<p>I added some processing to the sample, and layered in a heavily processed sound of bowing a de-tuned low B on a 5 string electric bass. Added some high-reverb guitar feedback, some Ah‚Äôs (thanks to my partner Kathryn for singing), synth strings, and some sax (both a pretty doubling of the string part and some frantic squealy playing and mouthpiece noises, thanks to my friend John). <a href="https://parallax.fyi/">Another friend</a> really outdid themselves with this insane drum part, which really caries an otherwise kinda boring track.</p>

<h2 id="week-3-i-like-your-style">Week 3: I LIKE YOUR STYLE</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>CHALLENGE: Hey new friend! Collaborate with someone you haven‚Äôt collaborated before.</p>

  <p>BONUS CHALLENGE: Make your song ‚Äúin the style of‚Äù another artist - a fellow jammer, a famous musical act, your mate jim, anyone!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I had plans to do a song in the style of Modest Mouse with a friend. We had some good ideas but were both too busy and nothing ever materialized. But I did finally finish a song I had written back in June, unreleated to the song jam.</p>

<h2 id="week-4-golden-record">Week 4: GOLDEN RECORD</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>CHALLENGE: There is an alien, somewhere. Or an astronaut, waiting. You‚Äôll never reach them, but you could broadcast. We‚Äôre making a new <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyager_Golden_Record">‚ÄúGolden Record‚Äù</a> What are you going to send?</p>

  <p>BONUS CHALLENGE: The space boffins really don‚Äôt want to waste any space on this disc - make it as long as you like, but make it count! Your song must be through-composed (no repeated sections).</p>

  <p>BONUS BONUS CHALLENGE: Humanity is at its best when we work together: have each track or instrument be performed/recorded/made by a separate person.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I ended up not doing a song of my own for this week either, but I did contribute a string bass part to <a href="https://larabartel.bandcamp.com/">someone else</a>‚Äôs song:</p>
